<h1>Cylinders vs Displacement</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project checks if cars with more cylinders actually have larger engines. Big Dawg, fictional client, thinks having more cylinders doesnâ€™t always mean a bigger engine, so he asked for an analysis to see if this is true. Using R and the mtcars dataset, look at the average engine size (displacement) for cars with different cylinder counts.

<h2>Languages and Utilities Used</h2>


- **R**: Used for data analysis, visualization, and report generation.
- **Quarto**: Creates a reproducible report combining code and text.
- **tidyverse**: For data manipulation and visualization.
- **knitr** and **kableExtra**: Styles and formats tables for readability.
- **ggplot2**: Creates visualizations to display analysis results.
- **Git** and **GitHub**: Manages version control and branches for safe feature development.
