<h1>Cylinders vs Displacement</h1>



<h2>Description</h2>
This project checks if cars with more cylinders actually have larger engines. Big Dawg, fictional client, thinks having more cylinders doesnâ€™t always mean a bigger engine, so he asked for an analysis to see if this is true. Using R and the mtcars dataset, look at the average engine size (displacement) for cars with different cylinder counts.
